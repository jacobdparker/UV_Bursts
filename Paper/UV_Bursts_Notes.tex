\section{Notes}

	This is an example of how you use a .bib file in LateX.  It seems that the first paper exploring these bursts with IRIS what authored by Hardi Peter \citep{Peter2014}.  \citet{Peter2014} found some very interesting Si {\sc IV} line profiles that had both large bi-directional Doppler shifts, and absorption for the Ni {\sc II} photospheric line.  \citet{Judge2015} came back in 2015 with a paper refuting that these profiles are the result of magnetic reconnection and instead attributes them to Alfv\'enic turbulence.  It would be worth while to study the differences between these interpretations to determine the real cause of these EEs.
	
\section{Open Questions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Are EEs, Bombs, and Bursts all the same phenomena?
		\item Are the above actually cause reconnection?
	
	\end{itemize}
