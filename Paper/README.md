  I hope that this folder can help us keep notes.  Things that can be managed through this are: .bib for papers of interest,
notes on these papers in UV_Bursts_Notes.tex, and eventually the paper.

  I would also like to note open questions we have or those posed in other papers.  Hopefully this will help steer the project.
